RunItBack is a tool to help you export your data from <a href="https://www.dribbble.com">Dribbble</a>. Ready to get started? [RunItBack](https://ruckus-labs.github.io/runitback/)!

## How To Use

RunItBack was designed to take data (the `export.json` file) from Dribbble's Data Export tool. To use RunItBack, you'll first need to grab your own `export.json` file from Dribbble.

1. Navigate to your Account Settings (under your profile image in the upper right).
2. Click (or navigate to) the [Data Export](https://dribbble.com/account) tab.
3. Initiate the data request by clicking on the "Request data" button.
4. Check your email (found under [Account Settings](https://dribbble.com/account)) for an email from Dribbble with a link to your data export file.
5. Once you have you your `export.json` file, you can use RunItBack to generate a ZIP file with all (or some) of your shots and associated data including: description, tags, and original publish date.

## Known Limitations

-    RunItBack currently doesn't support GIF or video backups.
